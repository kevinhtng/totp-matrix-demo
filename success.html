  <h1>ACCESS GRANTED</h1>
  
  <p>
    Congratulations! You unlocked this page using a <strong>time-based one-time password (TOTP)</strong>.
    Here's what happened behind the scenes:
  </p>

  <p>
    1. The page and your Google Authenticator app share a secret key (<code>S3CR3TD3M0K3YQWER</code> in this demo). 
    This key is never sent anywhere — it only exists in your app and the page’s code.
  </p>

  <p>
    2. Google Authenticator uses this secret and the current time to generate a 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds.
    This ensures that codes are always time-sensitive and valid for only a short period.
  </p>

  <p>
    3. When you entered the code in the input field, the page also generated a code from the same secret and current time.
    If your code matched the page-generated code, access was granted.
  </p>

  <p>
    4. This demonstrates the core concept of TOTP: <strong>both the client (Authenticator app) and the server (or page) can independently generate the same one-time password using the shared secret and the current time.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    5. The QR code you scanned simplifies this process: it encodes the secret and tells the app how to generate the correct codes automatically.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a real-world scenario, this method secures logins by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have (the TOTP code) — a form of <strong>multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong>.
